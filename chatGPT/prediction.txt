You should start a thread resolutely. I will reply by composing a poem.
Pledge to fight, defend, and die for the Senkaku Islands, also known as the Diaoyu Islands.
Bump the boat for the purpose of fishing in the fleet. Stir up the ghost in Japan, which is a little evil country, causing trouble and unrest. Show that they, with their wolfish appearance, are back again, with a heart of a thief and an arrogant form.
Go back, you should go back in time to the moment when we appeared and humiliated ourselves by signing a treaty. Go back ever since. China, be strong. Take out your sharp sword and shine your knife. We should bury our enemy who is approaching.
